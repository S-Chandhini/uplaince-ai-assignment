Rock, paper, scissors game AI judge

Goal: Build a computer game called "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Bomb" featuring a window and clickable buttons.

Game Rules:

Standard Moves: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
The Bomb: Bomb beats Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
One-Time Use: Both you and the computer can only use the Bomb move once during the match. Once it's played, it can't be used again for the rest of that match.
How It Should Work:

Buttons: The screen needs big, clear buttons for Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Bomb. They'll be your controls.
Bomb Status: There should be an on-screen message displaying if your Bomb is "Ready" or "Empty" so you always know if you can use it.
Bomb Button Lock: When you press Bomb, that button should immediately stop working for you for the rest of the match - no accidental double clicks allowed.
Computer's Bomb: The computer picks moves randomly, but it should stick to the same Bomb rule: only one Bomb per match, and if it's used, it's out.
Results Message: After each round, show a message that simply says: "bot won", "user won", or "its a draw match".
Play Again Option: After every turn, give me the option to play another round.
